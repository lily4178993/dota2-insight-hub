        Hi there! My name is Nelly Telli, and I'm a software engineer with a passion for web development and problem-solving. I love building responsive web applications and creating clean, maintainable code.

        My favorite quote is, 
        <strong>
          “The only way to do great work is to love what you do”
        </strong>
         by Steve Jobs. I strongly believe in the importance of loving your work and staying curious to keep learning and growing.
